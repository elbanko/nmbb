                <h4><b><u>Effective As Of: 6/21/2018</u></b></h4>
<br>

                <p>The following general terms of service and other conditions herein (collectively referred to as “TOS”) apply to all validly licensed attorneys seeking potential in-house legal career opportunities (“Attorney Applicants”), all entities or individuals who advertise in-house legal career opportunities (“Position Advertisers” or “Position Advertiser”) on No More Billables, Inc., a Florida corporation,  (“NMB” or “Site”) and any and all other users who access or use the site according to the TOS (“Users”). Collectively, Position Advertiser, Position Advertisers, Attorney Applicants, and all other Users may also be referred to as “You”, “Yours”, “Yourself”, “They” or any other similar pronoun referents (without regard to capitalization or plurals) in the TOS. In the event of any ambiguities in this TOS or on the Site, such ambiguities shall not be resolved against NMB in its role as drafter.</p>
<br>
                <h3><b><u>1.The NMB Advertising Services:</u></b></h3>
<br>
                <p>NMB may advertise, on the Site, position advertisements provided by Position Advertisers (“Position Advertisements”) as well as additional content which may include links to third-party websites. Position Advertisements are created exclusively by Position Advertisers. All Users and Attorney Applicants understand and voluntarily agree that NMB is not responsible for verifying, correcting or otherwise validating any Position Advertisements. The Position Advertisements contained on, or linked from, the Site may be posted automatically by the Position Advertisers directly or by NMB in a ministerial capacity only. <b>NMB expressly assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for the following: the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, enforceability or availability of any Position Advertisements. NMB is primarily an advertising platform that allows Position Advertisers the ability to post Position Advertisements on the Site.</b></p>
<br>
                <h3><b><u>2.Notice to Attorney Applicants:</u></b></h3>
<br>
                <p>If you are an Attorney Applicant, you must apply directly to the Position Advertisers. <b>NEVER APPLY, EMAIL OR OTHERWISE SEND RESUMES, COVER LETTERS, SALARY INFORMATION OR ANY OTHER PERSONAL OR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TO NMB.</b> NMB does not guarantee that a Position Advertiser will receive or respond to any materials sent directly to them. NMB may also send Attorney Applicants or other Users general emails or Position Advertisements in its discretion. Under no circumstance is NMB responsible for the content of any Position Advertiser’s application form, follow-up messages, interview processes, evaluation questions, background checks, hiring procedures, employment offers or any other aspect of the hiring and employment process. <b>NMB does not guarantee the stated identity of a Position Advertiser or the identity of any individuals working for any Position Advertisers. Attorney Applicants, when applying directly to Position Advertisements, agree they may be identified as an applicant by the Position Advertiser or by other third parties having access to Position Advertiser’s data. <u>All Attorney Applicants MUST use their own resources and due diligence to verify any and all aspects of any Position Advertisement before applying, interviewing or accepting any position advertised on Site by a Position Advertiser. All Attorney Applicants understand and agree that they are applying to  Position Advertisements at their own risk. NMB recommends, if an Attorney Applicant applies to a Position Advertisement, that they advise the Position Advertiser in writing that their search is in strict confidence and that any disclosure of their information to third parties is strictly prohibited. Attorney Applicants understand and agree that NMB is an advertising website and not an employment agency, staffing company or recruiting firm.</u></b></p>
<br>
                <h3><b><u>3.Notice To Position Advertisers:</u></b></h3>
<br>
                <p>By creating an NMB account or by posting a Position Advertisement on the Site, it is agreed that these TOS and all of NMB’s policies, including the NMB Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy are applicable. When a Position Advertiser creates an NMB account or posts a Position Advertisement, the Position Advertiser warrants and represents they have a bona fide legal position. Position Advertiser is solely responsible for the content of all Position Advertisements. Position Advertiser represents, warrants and otherwise guarantees to NMB, Attorney Applicants and any other User of the site that all Position Advertisements fully comply with all local, state and federal laws. <b><u>NMB does not, in any manner, verify, research, confirm or otherwise warrant the identity, compensation, skills, licenses, backgrounds, references, personal motivations, training or any other qualifications of any Attorney Applicants who apply to Position Advertisements. NMB PROVIDES NO GUARANTEES, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES IN ANY MANNER REGARDING AN ATTORNEY APPLICANT OR USER AT ANY TIME.</u></b> Position Advertisers agree not to share, and otherwise keep completely confidential from third-parties, any and all information about any Attorney Applicant that may apply to a Position Advertisement. <b>Position Advertisers shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless NMB, its agents, affiliates, employees, officers, directors and licensors from any Attorney Applicant claim, User claim, or any other third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of, related to, or from, any Position Advertisements advertised on NMB . Position Advertisers understand and agree that NMB is an advertising website and not an employment agency, staffing company or recruiting firm.</b></p>
<br>
                <h2><b><u>4.Additional Site Information:</u></b></h2>
<br>
                <p>NMB may provide certain types of information on its Site. All information contained on NMB or sent as emails to Attorney Applicants, Position Advertisers or other Users is for informational purposes only and is not to be considered, or used as, legal, tax, career, financial or any other type of professional advice under any circumstances. At all times, Attorney Applicants are exclusively responsible for managing and directing their own careers, career decisions and employment choices.  Any emails or email notifications corresponding with any actions taken on the Site are provided solely as a courtesy.</p>
<br>
                <h2><b><u>5.Non Commercial Use of Site:</u></b></h2>
<br>
                <p>Unless otherwise authorized in writing by NMB, no Attorney Applicant, Position Advertiser or any other User is permitted to use NMB’s Site or its content for any other purpose than those designated in the TOS. Use of any automated system or software, whether operated by a third party or otherwise, to extract data from the Site (such as screen scraping or crawling) is prohibited. NMB reserves the right to take such action as it considers necessary, including issuing legal proceedings without further notice, in relation to any unauthorized use of the Site.</p>
<br>
                <h2><b><u>6.Additional Disclosures:</u></b></h2>
<br>
                <p>NMB reserves the right to disclose all Position Advertisements, Users and Attorney Applicant information, and the circumstances surrounding their transmission, to any third party in connection with operating the Site; to protect itself, its affiliates, its partners and its visitors; and to comply with its legal obligations or governmental requests. This means, for example, that NMB may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to reveal a user’s electronic address and identity or other properly requested information. As a Position Advertiser, when you post a Position Advertisement on NMB that you choose to list as confidential, your identity may be discoverable by request from the government or law enforcement or by a User or Attorney Applicant’s own due diligence or research.</p>
<br>
                <p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and in addition to the other terms and conditions herein, NMB reserves the right to remove or not advertise any Position Advertisement that it reasonably believes directly or indirectly discriminates against Attorney Applicants. Direct discrimination means, for example, that a Position Advertisement specifically makes clear that only Attorney Applicants matching a certain criteria are wanted, thereby excluding others because of a legally prohbited reason- for example, their gender, race, age or disability. Indirect discrimination means, for example, that a Position Advertisements implicitly excludes certain classes of Attorney Applicants by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job requirements or otherwise have a disparate impact. Position Advertisers understand and agree to refrain from posting any Position Advertisements that directly or indirectly discriminate against Attorney Applicants or otherwise violate applicable federal, state and local laws as previously provided herein.

                    <li>any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described herein.</li></li>

If any such Feedback is provided, NMB is granted a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub licensable (through multiple layers of sub licensees) right and license to make, use, sell, sublicense, reproduce, distribute, perform, display, prepare derivative works from and otherwise exploit all such Feedback for any purpose without restriction.

<br>
            <h2><b><u>14.Claims of Infringement:</u></b></h2>
<br>
            <p>U.S. Copyright Infringement. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by NMB infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC. § 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow NMB to locate the material on the site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send NMB a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent in writing to NMB at its business address on its home page. Please consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>
<br>
            <h2><b><u>15.Governing Law and Dispute Resolution:</u></b></h2>
<br>
            <p>If you are an Attorney Applicant, Position Advertiser or any other User, if a dispute arises out of, or relates to, the Site, this TOS, NMB’s Privacy Policy or NMB’s Cookie Policy or for any other reason, if the dispute cannot be settled by negotiation, the parties agree to first try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Mediation Procedures (as defined by AAA) before resorting to arbitration as provided herein. If mediation is unsuccessful after at least two separate attempts conducted at least seven (7) business days apart, then it is agreed that any controversy or claim arising out of, or relating to, this TOS, or breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in a Florida state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof. Venue for any such arbitration is in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Florida law will be applied to all matters in dispute. <b><u>In the event this arbitration clause is determined to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction in Broward County, Florida, you hereby voluntarily, knowingly and freely waive any right to a jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to your use of the Site or these terms of service. At all times, each party shall be fully responsible for their own attorneys fees and costs, including all appeals.
